Project 2 Group Leader Report
Emily Jackson

Group members: Emily Jackson (leader), Kathryn Soll, Anthony Zheng, Jacob Shaw
Group: Heapsters

Project 2 was done through GitHub with not much in-person interaction. We divided the responsibilities into frontend and backend. Emily and Kathryn worked on SQL queries on the backend, while Anthony and Jacob worked on creating the frontend with PHP.

Each of the members contributed and worked together very well.
